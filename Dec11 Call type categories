# Idea! so our beta data is again experiencing some problems. 
# I think that it is ok to just grab the call data from the Dade county
# old data that is tied to the tracts we currently have. We know all the tracts we
# currently have are all in the city of Miami. This should solve the problem. 
# Also we can just use all the data since we don't care about the delayed variable anymore

# Load in the data and the packages (dplyr and tidyverse)
