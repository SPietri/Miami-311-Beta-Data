# So my professor spoke to the IT manager of the Miami 311 data last week and to all of 
# our surpise, we haven't been using the best version of the Miami 311 data out there.

# GREAT! This means that all of the analysis will need to be redone. FANTASTIC! I am 
# a bit salty but honestly this will be good for me. As, I continue to learn and practice 
# I am constantly thinking I could improve this analysis by doing this differently the 
# second time around or I am catching mistakes or just bad coding practices. So, here we
# go again and it's pretty simple stuff just like cleaning and creating new variables. 

# I have also been making more use of Excel for cleaning purposes. It takes less time
# and I really like the fact that I can see my data at once which can't be done in R. 

# The new data I will be working with today I will refer to Beta_data. It is in the beta 
# version on the 311 website but the director assures us that this is the most accurate.
# Beta_data differes from the original data in many ways. To start, it doesn't have the
# same cases, it includes different issue types, but the methods are the same. Also Beta
# _data, includes ONLY completed calls. 

# As of right now, I am in Excel getting rid of the empty column called Issue Description
# and I am only selecting the methods that my professor would like to analyze. These
# methods are 311 calls that only citizens have called in. The methods are: 
   ### MOBILE
   ### IPHONE
   ### ANDROID
   ### EMAIL
   ### WEB
   ### WALKIN
   ### FAX
   ### OTHER
   ### MAIL
   ### MAYOFF
   ### SOCIALMEDIA
   ### PHONE
   ### *** beta_data does not include a fax method. 

# The original data had 201,794 rows and after selecting only the wanted methods, 
# the data has 199,870 call reports.

# The data is now cleaned and has no missing addresses or methods but it still has
# incomplete Actual.Completed.Days rows. I don't thing this is too important for the 
# methods analysis as we are wanting to explore how the calls come in. 

# There are 69 issue types. 

# Now lets import the clean csv. 
beta_data <- read.csv("Sept26_BetaData_clean.csv")

# Awesome it's in! 
sum(is.na(beta_data$Method.Received) ==TRUE)
   ### This returns 0. 

# Let's get some percentages of the specific methods per the amount of calls.I switched 
# computers so I have to re-install everything...
