# Creating function:
myzscore <- function(x){
  for (i in 1:length(x)){
    x[i] <- (x[i] - mean(x))/sd(x)
  }
  return(x)
}

#Checking function...
c <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
myzscore(c)
#sd(c) = 1.87
#mean = 3.5
# It worked

bd.tracts_oct26 %>%

# The above worked but not what I want...

### PROBLEM: I can't combine z scores of several calls in a tract
### into one "averaged z score" for the entire tract. Can't treat 
### a set of z scores as a z score. 

### SOLUTION: Per this study, you could sum the z scores using simple averaging.
### I'm doing this per tract. 

composite_delayed_score<- bd.tracts_oct26 %>%
  select(TRACTCE10, D, delayed)%>%
  mutate(z = myzscore(delayed))%>%
  group_by(TRACTCE10)%>%
  summarize(stand_composite_score = sum(z))

# i THOUGHT PERHAPS TO GROUP THEM BY THE issue type first but there is no need because they are 
# standardized by the z score
# NO: composite_score<- bd.tracts_oct26 %>%
  #select(Issue.Type, delayed, TRACTCE10)%>%
  #group_by(Issue.Type)%>%
  #mutate(z = myzscore(delayed))%>%
  #ungroup()%>%
  #group_by(TRACTCE10)%>%
  #summarize(stand_composite_score = sum(z))
